At this moment, When I say user, I also mean developper, because they
are two different roles in one person (myself).

The user needs to specify:
* a foo.h file
** that defines the input type,
** that defines the interface of foo function
* a port.py file
** that defines how we port the C foo_r to python's
** that defines the initial point
* (optional) a test file test.cpp
** that can be used for a sanity check

In this way, we should automate the whole process.

Requiring the user to provide such information may not be necessay
later.
